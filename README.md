# C-Practice

A comprehensive collection of daily C programming practice codes, exercises, and solutions documenting my journey in mastering the C programming language.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as my personal coding journal where I upload daily practice problems, exercises, and experimental code snippets in C. It's a continuous learning project that showcases my progress and understanding of C programming concepts from basics to advanced topics.

## What You'll Find Here

### Core Programming Concepts
- **Variables and Data Types**: Practice with different data types, type casting, and variable declarations
- **Control Structures**: Implementation of loops, conditional statements, and decision-making constructs
- **Functions**: Function definitions, parameter passing, recursion, and modular programming
- **Arrays**: Single and multi-dimensional arrays, array manipulation, and algorithms
- **Pointers**: Pointer arithmetic, memory management, and pointer-based operations
- **Strings**: String handling, manipulation functions, and character arrays
- **Structures and Unions**: Custom data types, nested structures, and memory organization

### Advanced Topics
- **File I/O**: File operations, reading/writing data, and file handling techniques
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: malloc, calloc, realloc, and memory management
- **Data Structures**: Implementation of stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees
- **Algorithms**: Sorting algorithms, searching techniques, and problem-solving approaches
- **Preprocessor Directives**: Macros, conditional compilation, and header files

### Problem Categories
- **Mathematical Problems**: Number theory, calculations, and mathematical algorithms
- **Pattern Programs**: Star patterns, number patterns, and geometric designs
- **String Manipulation**: Text processing, parsing, and string algorithms
- **Array Problems**: Searching, sorting, and array-based challenges
- **Logic Building**: Puzzles, brain teasers, and algorithmic thinking exercises
